# Programming in C - Assignment 1

## Description

This program is part of **Assignment 1** for the **Programming in C** course. It is designed to accept and process student data, including their name, grades for three subjects, and compute the average score. It then displays individual student results, including their pass/fail status, and shows a summary of all students' performance.

## Features
- Input a student's name and grades for 3 subjects.
- Calculate the total marks and average for each student.
- Display the pass/fail status based on the average score.
- Allow entry of multiple students and provide a summary of all students.
- Handles invalid grade inputs (grades must be between 0 and 100).

## Program Flow

1. The program prompts for the student's name.
2. The program requests the names of 3 subjects and their corresponding grades.
3. The grades are validated to ensure they are within the range of 0 to 100.
4. The average grade for each student is calculated, and their results are displayed.
5. The program asks if you want to add another student.
6. Once all students have been entered, a summary of the total number of students and the overall average is displayed.
